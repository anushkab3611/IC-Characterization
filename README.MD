# IC-Characterization
This GitHub repository is created to provide hands-on experience in Analog IC Characterization using open-source tools such as **NGSpice**, **Xschem**, and the **SKY130 PDK**.
## What is Analog IC Characterization ?
Analog IC (Integrated Circuit) Characterization is the process of evaluating and measuring the electrical performance of an analog circuit under various conditions. This involves testing key parameters such as gain, offset, bandwidth, noise, power consumption, input/output impedance, temperature stability, and process variation sensitivity.

Characterization is carried out using tools like **Ngspice, Spectre, HSPICE, Eldo** (Simulation) and **Xschem** (Schematic) providing a complete framework for accurate simulation and analysis of analog circuits.

Characterization is usually performed post-design (pre- and post-fabrication) to ensure the circuit behaves as intended across different corners:

- Process Corners: Variations in manufacturing (e.g., TT, FF, SS).

- Voltage Corners: Operating at min/max supply voltages.

- Temperature Corners: Measuring across temperature range (e.g., -40°C to 125°C).
